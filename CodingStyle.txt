Javadoc and coding styles:

All functions and variable are declared in camel-casing (ex. baseFunction)

All classes start in pascal-casing (ex. BaseClass)

All comments should be constructed as JavaDoc annotations:
/**
*
* All comments should be here
*
* Short description of functions purpose / logic
* @param <parameter name> Short description of parameter
* @return type of the return and short description of the object
*/

All if/else calls should be encapsulated by brackets {}

Brackets should start at first line of declaration and end in a new line with the same indentation and declaration

All class specific variables should be private, if they are needed outside of the class, try to use getters/ setters.

# Test name, please ignore



[We use GitHub as our revision controller](https://github.com/Njallzzz/Tic-Tac-Toe "Projects repository")


All features are done on a seperate branch. (Feature branches)

We write tests first push to branch then build a feature ( TDD )

We try to work in pairs when programming

We can run tests locally at first or the deployment server.

Final test must be run on the deployment server on a branch that is up to date with master.
We make sure final tests passes before making a pull request. (Automated with Travis)

At least 2 people are required to have commented and reviewed the changes before we merge to master branch (including the person that accepts the merge).


Non-reviewed pull requests should be never be merged to master branch without the product owners permission ( [Totally the email of PO ] ("mailto:orlygur@ourlordandsaviour.is")
